1,Ostium Secundum Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) is a common congenital heart defect characterized by an opening in the atrial septum. ,"The Ostium Secundum ASD is situated in the central part of the atrial septum, specifically at the region of the fossa ovalis.


The size can range from a small pinhole to a large opening that can cause significant shunting of blood between the atria. The size of the defect influences the degree of left-to-right shunting and the clinical significance of the ASD.
",Left to right shunt,"The primary factor controlling shunting direction is the pressure gradient between the left and right atria. Under normal circumstances, the left atrium has higher pressure than the right atrium, leading to a left-to-right shunt.

The ability of the atrial walls to stretch and accommodate changes in blood volume can affect the direction of the shunt. Less compliant (stiffer) atria may resist incoming blood flow, altering the shunt direction.",Right ventricle,"Diastolic potential right-to-left shunt due to increased right ventricular diastolic pressure impacting right atrial pressure.

Systolic  -  likely left-to-right shunt due to higher left atrial pressure, provided the systolic function remains good and there is no significant elevation in right atrial pressure.

","The location relative to the AV valves. ASD is typically located at the atrial level away from AV valves, and inlet perimembranous VSD is located at the ventricular level near the tricuspid and mitral valve apparatus.
","The likely direction of shunting of blood would be left-to-right.

","The primary reason for the direction of shunting is the pressure difference between the left and right sides of the heart. This pressure gradient drives blood from the higher-pressure left side to the lower-pressure right side through the septal defect, resulting in a left-to-right shunt.
",Ventricular Septal Defect ,Right Ventricular Outflow Tract , Overriding Aorta,"The ventricular conduction tissue, specifically the bundle of His and the right bundle branch, would lie near the VSD. In the context of TOF, the bundle of His runs along the inferior edge of the membranous septum. The right bundle branch then travels towards the right ventricular outflow tract. ",Two potentially deleterious consequences of the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt leading to 92% saturations include pulmonary overcirculation and the development of pulmonary vascular disease., Oval Fossa Atrial Septal Defect ,"Oval Fossa ASD is located in the central part of the atrial septum at the region of the fossa ovalis, which is the remnant of the fetal foramen ovale. While inferior Sinus Venosus ASD is located near the junction of the right atrium and the inferior caval vein (ICV). This defect is positioned lower in the atrial septum, close to the entry of the ICV.","Left-to-right.
","With severe tricuspid valve stenosis, the direction of shunting could potentially be right-to-left during diastole due to increased right atrial pressure but is likely left-to-right during systole due to the higher left atrial pressure.",Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome ,"The left ventricle is severely underdeveloped, which is characteristic of HLHS. It is significantly smaller than the right ventricle and cannot effectively pump blood to the systemic circulation.

Abnormality in the mitral valve could be atretic (completely closed) or stenotic (narrowed). This prevents normal blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle.

The aorta is small and underdeveloped, consistent with aortic atresia or severe aortic stenosis. This abnormality restricts blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic circulation.","The four main components of the Norwood Procedure (first stage of surgical palliation for HLHS) are the creation of a neoaorta, surgical shunt, atrial septectomy, and aortic arch reconstruction.","Anterior - Bordered by the tricuspid valve's septal leaflet.
Posterior - Near the membranous septum.
Superior - Close to the pulmonary valve.
Inferior -  Extends towards the muscular septum.

VSD is located in the septum between the right and left ventricles, just beneath the tricuspid valve's septal leaflet, indicating it is a perimembranous VSD.

",Along the inferior edge of the membranous septum,The proximity to the aortic and tricuspid valves and the closeness to the ventricular conduction system.,The right ventricle would be enlarged due to the left-to-right shunt increasing the volume load on the right ventricle.,The ventricular topology is L-looped ventricles (L-TGA).,"In the context of L-TGA with discordant ventriculo-arterial connections, the most common pattern of coronary arterial origins, according to the Leiden convention is:

The right-hand facing sinus usually gives rise to the left coronary artery.
The left-hand facing sinus usually leads to the right coronary artery.","The AV node is typically located in the usual position in the morphologic right atrium but is displaced inferiorly and posteriorly.

The bundle of His courses anteriorly and to the left from the AV node, running along the inferior aspect of the VSD (if present), before branching into the right and left bundle branches.","Pulmonary atresia often leads to significant anatomical distortion of the heart and great vessels. This can displace the usual anatomical landmarks that guide the placement of the conduction system.

Surgical interventions required to palliate or correct pulmonary atresia (such as shunts or complex reconstructions) can further alter the anatomy, impacting the location and course of the conduction tissue. The need to create new pathways for blood flow can result in the repositioning or even damage the conduction pathways.","The bronchial arrangement is situs solitus, characterized by the left lung having two lobes and the right lung having three lobes.","Abnormal embryonic development and gene expression, particularly involving Nodal, Lefty, and Pitx2, are responsible for establishing left-right asymmetry and situs solitus.","Three anatomic abnormalities of the conduction system that could be present in this patient with AVSD include displacement of the AV node, abnormal positioning or formation of the Bundle of His, and accessory pathways.
",The main effect of the trans-annular patch on valve function is pulmonary regurgitation.,The right ventricular ejection volume must increase to compensate for the regurgitation.,This is achieved by right ventricular dilation and changes in sarcomeric configuration (lengthening and potential hypertrophy).,The dilation of the right ventricle will increase the wall tension.,The law that describes the change in wall tension is Laplace's Law. ,The changes in sarcomeric configuration include lengthening of the sarcomeres and a potential increase in the number of sarcomeres in series and parallel.,"The right Ventricle (RV) is connected to the pulmonary artery.

Superior - near the base of the aortic valve.

It is located in the membranous part of the interventricular septum, extending into the muscular septum, indicating it is a perimembranous VSD.","The obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract can cause a reversal of the shunt direction across the VSD, leading to right-to-left shunting and cyanosis.","Addressing the obstruction during surgical repair is crucial to preventing cyanosis, reducing right ventricular pressure, improving surgical outcomes, and optimising hemodynamics.",The direction of blood flow in the arterial duct would be right-to-left.,Cyanosis,"The syndrome is called Eisenmenger Syndrome, and PVR is more significant due to progressive changes in the pulmonary vasculature leading to pulmonary hypertension.", Medial hypertrophy and intimal proliferation/fibrosis in the pulmonary arteries.,"Borders:
